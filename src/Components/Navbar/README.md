# About the navbar

The ```Login``` and ```Modal``` components aren't being used for now. We moved away from a login modal to a ```URLGenerator``` for the simple reason that users would probably not create accounts. We'll revisit the conceptâ€”the login feature would probably be useful in tandem with ```URLGenerator``` if users wanted to keep multiple timetables going, for example.

May also use ```Modal``` for an instructional popup on first visit, but hopefully the interface speaks for itself.
